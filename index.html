                        <ul>
                            <li>The goal of the game is to finish every card on your hand by droping them all, for this there are some rules of dropping. Some cards will help you to drop cards and some cards will help you by making your opponents take up more cards or jump turns.</li>
                            <li>Shuffle the cards and give each player same amount of cards (usually 6) except for the first player (who gets +1 than everyone usually 7).</li>
                            <li>Every player will drop cards of the same type that the game is on and the first player decides what the game type will be but also there's a card to change the game type, if you drop that card and demand a change you can. (for example: from spades to heart or from heart to flower)</li>
                            <li>Put the rest of the card in the middle for everyone to draw cards from it when they don't have the right cards in their set to drop. And taking a card from the middle is must if you don't the appropriate card in your set.</li>
                            <li>Ace(Ace of spades) will make your opponent take 5 cards from the middle cards.</li>
                            <li>2 will make your opponent take 2 cards but if you have another 2 of any kind on your hand you can drop that and the next player will take 4 cards, continues like this.</li>
                            <li>5 will make the next player jump turn so the next player after him or the third player will go.</li>
                            <li>7 will help you to drop cards with the same sign, if you have 7 of hearts you can drop every heart card with it and works on every sign of seven.</li>
                            <li>8 and J will help you to change the sign of the game to whichever you want but if the former player used that kind of card and changed the game right before now it's not possible.</li>
                            <li>Finally as the name of the game says if you don't say "last card(Keregn)" with words each time you have 1 card left or you go without your turn your opponents can say "crazy" and you'll have to take up 5 cards.</li>

                            <li>The card signs are of no relevance for this game only the numbers matter.</li>
                            <li>Take 4 cards from the top of the cards in the middle and put them on their visible face. This is just to set the game in motion. Let the four cards be 1, 2, 3 and 4.</li>
                            <li>Now the first person plays and draws one from the shuffled cards and lets say he got 2 so we also have 2 in the visible cards so we take that out. Cards left are 1, 3 and 4</li>
                            <li>Second person plays and draws one from the shuffled cards again and lets say he got 5 this time so we have 1 + 4 as 5 so he takes that. The card left is 3 only.</li>
                            <li>Third person goes and if he draws 5 again he can take the second person's whole card because the second person have 1, 4, and 5 which becomes a sum for the third player</li>
                            <li>Fourth person got 6 when he draws and now there is no 6 anywhere so he'll put the 6 in. If any of the next persons to draw gets 6 they will take the fourth player's 6.</li>
